GitHub is an increasingly popular programming resource used for code sharing. It's a social networking site for programmers that many companies and organizations use to facilitate project management and collaboration. According to statistics collected in October 2020, it is the most prominent source code host, with over 60 million new repositories created in 2020 and boasting over 56 million total developers.

The Git version control system, as the name suggests, is a system that records all the modifications made to a file or set of data so that a specific version may be called up later if needed. The system makes sure that all the team members are working on the fileâ€™s latest version, and everyone can work simultaneously on the same project.
